/**
 * Notion enforces an average of 3 requests/second PER INTEGRATION TOKEN
 * — and because this bot uses one shared OAuth app across every
 * connected user workspace, that ceiling is shared across ALL accounts
 * combined, not per-account. This is a real outbound throttle (queues
 * and waits for a slot), not a reject-based limiter like
 * middleware/rateLimit.ts — we choose when to call Notion, so the
 * correct behavior is "wait your turn," not "refuse the request."
 *
 * HONEST LIMITATION: in-memory, single-process — correct for Render's
 * free tier (one instance). If you ever run multiple instances, this
 * would need to move to a shared token bucket (e.g. a Supabase-backed
 * counter) since each instance would otherwise think it has the full
 * budget to itself.
